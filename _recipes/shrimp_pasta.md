> Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add butter and melt. Add shrimp in a single layer and cook until golden brown on each side, turning only once. You may have to cook shrimp in two batches to allow enough room. Once done cooking, transfer cooked shrimp to a clean plate and reduce heat to medium low.

* `240 mL` heavy cream
* `50 g` parmesan, grated

> Add the heavy cream to pan and scrape the bottoms to release any food that is stuck. Allow the cream to bubble. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the parmesan cheese to melt. Add cooked pasta and shrimp and stir to coat.
