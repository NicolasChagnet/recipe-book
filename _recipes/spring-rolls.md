* `8 sheets` roll dough
* `300g` cabbage
* `60g` carrots

> To prepare the spring rolls, first defrost the ready-made pastry and cover them with a slightly damp cloth to prevent them from drying out. Clean and cut the cabbage, onions and carrots into thin strips.

---

* peanut oil

> Heat the wok over high heat, then pour in the seed oil and the onions. Fry for a couple of minutes, then add the carrots and cabbage. Season with salt and pepper.

---

> Also add the rice wine and sauté the vegetables for 4-5 minutes: they should be cooked but still crunchy. Transfer the vegetables to a colander to eliminate the excess liquid, then spread them out a little with the chopsticks to better preserve their colour and consistency.

---

> At this point you can compose the rolls: place one sheet of pastry at a time on the tea towel with one corner facing you and add a handful of filling on the lower half. Fold the lower corner upwards and roll up without pressing to cover the filling, then fold the corners at the sides towards the centre.

---

* egg white

> Finally, roll up the roll from the bottom up and seal the pastry by moistening the edges with a little egg white, you can use your fingers or a brush. Do not press too much or the pastry could break. Proceed in this way to form all the rolls.

---

> Now heat the wok again, then pour in plenty of seed oil and bring it to a temperature of 180°C. When the oil is at temperature, lower the heat slightly and fry a few rolls at a time, turning them on both sides.

---

> When they are golden brown on both sides, drain the spring rolls and place them on kitchen paper to absorb the excess oil. Serve your spring rolls while still hot accompanied with spicy or sweet and sour sauce!
