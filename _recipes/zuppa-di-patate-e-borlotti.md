* `250g` dry Borlotti beans

> To prepare the potato and borlotti bean soup, start by soaking the dried borlotti beans in cold water (if you use fresh ones, omit this step) for about 10/12 hours. Then cook them for 15 minutes in a pressure cooker, with salted water (if you want you can also add a carrot and a stick of celery) or for about 40 minutes in a normal pot. Once cooked, drain them, keeping the water.

* `1` carrot
* `1` white onion
* `1` celery
* `1` garlic clove
* `80g` smoked pancetta
* `3` potatoes

> In the meantime, clean the onion, carrot and celery and chop them finely, peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes, chop half of the smoked bacon. Place the extra virgin olive oil in a pan and add the garlic clove, the chopped onion, carrot and celery and the sage leaves, let them wilt and then add the smoked bacon that you have chopped and the remaining one in cubes. When the bacon is browned, add the potato cubes and brown them. Then add 4/5 ladles of the cooking water from the beans and cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, that is, until the potatoes are tender, if necessary add more cooking water.

* Grana padano

> Season with salt, pepper well and if you prefer, remove the garlic clove that will have released its aroma. Finally, add the cooked borlotti beans and let everything flavor for another two minutes. Take about half of the soup and chop it finely with an immersion blender. Add the cream thus obtained to the rest of the soup. Serve the potato and borlotti soup piping hot with grated Grana Padano and a drizzle of raw extra virgin olive oil!
