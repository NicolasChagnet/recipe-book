* `1 kg` Russet potatoes
* `1 tsp` baking soda
* `1 tsp` salt

> Fill a large pot with water and boil. Add salt, baking soda, and potatoes, and stir.

---


> Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes after returning to a boil. A fork should easily pierce the potato pieces by the end. Drain and let sit one minute while moisture evaporates.

* `60 mL` olive oil
* `1 clove` garlic
* `2 tbsp` herb (e.g, rosemary, thyme)

> Combine olive oil, herbs, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Stir constantly until the garlic just begins to turn golden, about 2-3 minutes.

---

> Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer over the potatoes. Add salt and pepper to taste, and mix.

---

> Shake the pot that the potatoes are in so that they slam against all sides of the pot, this will loosen the outer layer of the potatoes to form a mashed layer around each potato piece.

---

> Preheat the oven to 220°C.

---

> Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 30-35 minutes.

---

> Using a thin, flexible metal spatula flip potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.

---

> Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add the garlic-rosemary mixture (optional) and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
