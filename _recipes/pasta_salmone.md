* `400g` smoked salmon

> To prepare the salmon pasta, first bring a pot of water to a boil to cook the pasta and add salt to the boil. Cut the salmon into strips.
>
>>> Do not reduce the salmon into pieces that are too small otherwise they will fall apart in the pan.

* `½` golden onion
* parsley

> Peel and finely chop the onion, then also chop the parsley.

---

* `50g` white wine

> Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion , then add the salmon and raise the heat. After having sautéed the salmon for a few minutes, deglaze with the brandy and let it evaporate completely, then turn off the heat.

---

* `200g` cream, fresh, liquid

> At this point the water will have come to a boil, so add salt and cook the tagliatelle for the time indicated on the package. In the meantime, pour the cream into the pan with the salmon, always with the heat off. When the pasta are cooked, drain and transfer them directly to the pan.

> Turn the heat back on and mix well to reduce the sauce. Top with the chopped parsley and ground pepper and immediately serve your smoked salmon pasta!
