> Preheat the oven at 180°C.

## Make the crust

---

* `150 g` Cracker crumbs

> Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs.

---

* `70 g` butter, melted
* `50 g` granulated sugar

> Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. Mixture will be sandy.

---

> Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. Pre-bake for 8 minutes.

---

> Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.

## Filling

---

* `900 g` cream cheese, room temperature
* `200 g` granulated sugar

> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.

---

* `240 g` full-fat sour cream, room temperature
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract
* `2 tsp` lemon juice

> Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined.

---

* `3` large eggs

> On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing.
>
>>> To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.

## Baking

---

> Boil a pot of water and pour in a roasting pan. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan.

---

> Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven.

---

> Bake the cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan.
>
>>> If you notice the cheesecake browning too quickly on top, tent it with aluminum foil halfway through baking.

---

> Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely uncovered at room temperature. Then cover and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.

---

> Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water between each slice.

---

> Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
