> In a pan heat a drizzle of seed oil, and once it is hot, pour in the mixture. Cover with the lid 11 and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, turning the pan occasionally. When the surface is not very soft but still moist, carefully flip the frittata onto the lid by turning the pan with a firm and rapid movement.
> Slide the frittata back into the pan so that the other side is also cooked, cover again with the lid and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. After this, the frittata will be ready, you can serve it hot or cold.
>
>>> You can refrigerate the potato frittata in an airtight container for up to a day. Freezing is not recommended.
