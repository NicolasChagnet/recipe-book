* `¼ cup` almond slithers (optional)
* `1-2 tbs`p` powdered sugar (optional)

---

* `1 ¼ cups` sugar
* `1/2` zest of a small lemon

> Measure the sugar and zest into a large bowl. Using your fingertips, rub the zest into the sugar to release the oils.

---

* `¼ tsp` salt
* `¾ cup` milk
* `2 tsp` almond extract

> Add the flour, baking powder and salt, and fold in with a rubber spatula. Then fold in the milk and almond extract, mixing until you have only just achieved a smooth batter.

> Scrape the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Drop it from about an inch above the counter a few times to knock out any extra air bubbles. Sprinkle over the almond slithers, if using any.

---

> Bake for 40-50 minutes until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean.

---

> As soon as the tin is cool enough to touch transfer the cake out onto a cooling rack to cool completely before dusting with powdered sugar, if liked.
