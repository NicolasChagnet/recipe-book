* `390 g` flour
* `2 tsp` yeast
* `2 tsp` salt
* `375 mL` warm tap water (around 40°C)

> Mix flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add water, then use the handle of a wooden spoon to mix until all the flour is incorporated. Dough will be wet and sloppy – not kneadable

---

> Cover with cling wrap or plate, leave on counter for 2 - 3 hours until it doubles in volume, it’s wobbly like jelly and the top is bubbly. 
>
>>>If after 1 hour it doesn’t seem to be rising, move it somewhere warmer.

---

> Preheat the oven at 220°C.

* `1.5 tbsp` flour 

> Sprinkle work surface with 1 tbsp flour, scrape dough out of bowl. Sprinkle top with ½ tbsp flour. Using a dough scraper or anything of similar shape (cake server, large knife, spatula), fold the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a roundish shape. Don’t be too meticulous here – you’re about to deform it, it’s more about deflating the bubbles in the dough and forming a shape you can move.

> Slide a large piece of parchment/baking paper (not wax paper) next to the dough, then flip the dough upside down onto the paper (ie seam side down, smooth side up). Slide/push it towards the middle, then reshape it into a round(ish) shape. 
>
>>> Don't get too hung up about shape. In fact, lopsided = more ridges = more crunchy bits!

> Bake 30 minutes covered, then 12 minutes uncovered or until deep golden and crispy. Cool on rack for 10 minutes before slicing.
