* `20g` olive oil
* `250g` spinach
* `1 clove` garlic

> To prepare the spinach and ricotta meatballs, start by heating the oil together with a whole clove of garlic, add the previously washed spinach and let it sizzle over a high flame, cooking for 5-6 minutes and stirring often until soft.

---

> Remove the garlic and then drain the spinach in a colander, crushing them lightly with a spatula so as to lose the excess water and let them cool; once cold, chop them coarsely with a knife.

---

* `250g` ricotta
* `50g` Grana Padano

> At this point pour the ricotta into a bowl (if it has a lot of water, drain it first) and stir with spoon, then add the spinach and grated cheese, season with salt and pepper and mix.

---

* Bread crumbs

> Then, to give more consistency to the meatballs, add the breadcrumbs and continue to mix.

---

* `1` egg, beaten
* breadcrumbs

> As soon as the dough is ready you can take care of the formation of the meatballs. Then take some dough, about 20 grams, modeled with your hands; you will get about 24-26 small meatballs. Gradually pass them gently in a small bowl in which you will have beaten the egg together with salt and pepper, and then in another bowl in which there is breadcrumbs.

---

> Continue like this until you finish them all and gradually place them on a dripping pan lined with parchment paper (16-17). Cook the spinach and ricotta meatballs in a preheated oven, in static mode, at 200 Â° for about 20 minutes. Serve them hot!
