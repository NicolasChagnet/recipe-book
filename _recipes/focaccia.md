* `473 mL` flour
* `273 mL` lukewarm water
* `1 tsp`  yeast
* `1 tsp`  salt

> Lightly grease with olive oil, cover and leave in the fridge over night (12 hours roughly).

---

> The next morning deflate and transfer to a cast iron skillet or baking pan greased with a good glug of olive oil. Cover and leave for another couple hours (I usually wait 4 hours in time to bake for lunch).

> Preheat the oven to 210°C.

> Before baking, use your finger to indent lots of crevices and drizzle with more olive oil (around 2 tablespoons). Sprinkle with a little salt and any other topping you want.
