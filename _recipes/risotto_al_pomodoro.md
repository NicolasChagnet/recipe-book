* `125g` peeled tomatoes
* `1 tsp` sugar
* `2 tbsp` tomato sauce
* basil, chopped
* vegetable broth

> Add the peeled tomatoes to which you have added a teaspoon of sugar to remove the acidity, mix well and add a ladle of broth. Add two tablespoons of tomato sauce to taste. Continue to incorporate a ladle of broth every time the risotto dries, until cooked. When the cooking is almost completed, add some chopped basil, according to your tastes and season with salt if necessary.

>>> For the tomato risotto you can replace if you want the peeled tomatoes with 200 g of fresh tomatoes plus 200 ml of tomato sauce, or use only the puree, in this case the dose would be 400 ml of puree.

* `20g` butter
* `4 tbsp` Parmigiano Reggiano

> Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the butter, finally add the grated Grana Padano 8 and mix. Serve the tomato risotto hot and garnished with a few basil leaves.
