* `180 mL` powdered sugar
* `85 g`   softened butter
* `100 g`  almond meal
* `½ tsp`  vanilla extract

> Cream butter with sugar just until mixed. Add eggs one at a time, then mix in almond meal and vanilla. Cut out 2 round puff pastry sheets by using a lid or plate as mold. Add the stuffing to the center and spread until there's about 1 inch margin.

* `2` eggs

> Brush the margin with egg whites to help the sheets stick. Fold the other sheet of pastry on top. Seal the edge by cutting in around every inch with a knife. Egg-wash and score patterns on top to decorate.
