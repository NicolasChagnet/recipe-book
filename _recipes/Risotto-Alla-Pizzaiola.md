* `360 g` Carnaroli rice
* `300 g` tomato puree
* `1.5 L` vegetable broth
* `125 g` mozzarella fior di latte
* `1 clove` garlic
* fresh basil
* extra virgin olive oil
* salt
* black pepper optional

> To prepare the pizzaiola risotto, start with the tomato sauce. In a small saucepan, brown the garlic clove with the oil and add the tomato puree. Season with salt, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and let it cook for 15-20 minutes until it takes shape. In a separate saucepan, toast the rice with a drizzle of oil, then start cooking the risotto as usual: add a ladle of boiling vegetable stock at a time, making sure the previous one has been well absorbed before adding more.

> Halfway through cooking (after about 10 minutes) add two thirds of the tomato sauce and continue cooking, softening with more broth if necessary. Towards the end of cooking, add the last part of the tomato sauce and turn off the heat, stirring the rice until it is cooked. Stir in the thinly sliced ​​mozzarella and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

> Divide the pizzaiola risotto into individual plates, garnish with a few basil leaves, a sprinkling of pepper if desired, and serve immediately.
