* `4` eggs
* `100g` sugar

> To prepare tiramisÃ¹, start with very fresh eggs: carefully separate the egg whites from the yolks.
>
>>> Remember that to whip the egg whites well they must not contain any trace of yolk.
>
> Then whip the egg yolks with a hand mixer, pouring in only half of the sugar.

* `500g` Mascarpone

> As soon as the mixture has become clear and frothy, and with the mixer still running, you can add mascarpone cheese, little by little. When all the cheese is incorporated, you will have obtained a thick and compact cream; set it aside. Clean the mixer attachments very well and beat the egg whites, pouring in the remaining sugar a little at a time. Whisk them into stiff peaks.
>
>>> You will know they're ready if the mixture does not move when you overturn the bowl.

> Take a spoonful of egg whites and pour it into the bowl with egg yolks and sugar and stir vigorously with a spatula, to thin the mixture. Then proceed to add the remaining egg whites, little by little, stirring very gently from bottom to top.

* `300g` Ladyfingers
* `300g` coffee, freshly brewed

> Once ready, place a generous spoonful of cream on the bottom of a 12x8in baking pan and spread it evenly. Then soak the ladyfingers for a few moments in the cooled coffee, which you will have sweetened to your liking (we added only 1 teaspoon of sugar), first on one side and then the other.
> Arrange the soaked ladyfingers on top of the cream, side by side, to create the first layer, over which you will spread part of the mascarpone cheese cream.
>
>>> Make sure to level it carefully so that you have a smooth surface.

* Unsweetened cocoa powder

> Continue to arrange the coffee-soaked ladyfingers, then add another layer of cream. Level the surface, sprinkle it with unsweetened cocoa powder, and allow it to set in the fridge for a couple of hours.
