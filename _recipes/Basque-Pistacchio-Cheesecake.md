* `900 g` Philadelphia
* `200 g` icing sugar
* `6` eggs
* salt

> To prepare the Basque pistachio cheesecake, first collect the fresh cheese and the icing sugar in a very large bowl and work everything with an electric whisk until you obtain a smooth mixture. Add a pinch of salt and then the eggs, continuing to work until they are perfectly incorporated.

---

* `520 g` fresh cream
* `170 g` pistachio paste

> Add the cream, incorporating it well, then add the pistachio paste and mix.

---

* `30 g` corn starch
  
> Finally add the sifted cornstarch and mix with a spatula to combine everything again. When you have obtained a smooth and lump-free mixture, pour it into a 24cm diameter springform pan, buttered and lined with baking paper. Make sure that the paper protrudes about 5-7 cm from the edge and that there are no gaps between the ring and the base: by doing this, when the cheesecake increases in volume during cooking it will grow uniformly and then fall back on itself without ruining itself. Level and cook in a preheated oven at 200 Â°C for about 50 minutes.

> After this time you will notice that the surface of the cake will have become dark, the edges will have firmed up and the center will still be just a little wobbly. Turn off the oven, leaving the cake inside, with the door ajar, for 15-20 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool. When the Basque pistachio cheesecake has reached room temperature, transfer it to the refrigerator for at least 3 hours (but ideally overnight) before unmolding and serving.
