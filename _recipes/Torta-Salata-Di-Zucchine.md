* `40 g` grated parmesan cheese
* `220 mL` water
* `1 tsp` salt

> Mix with a hand whisk until the batter is smooth. Add the zucchini and chopped mint. Mix so that the zucchini are completely covered in the batter.

* `4 slices` cheese
* extra virgin olive oil
* breadcrumbs

> Transfer half of the mixture obtained into a non-stick pan previously greased with a little oil. Place the 4 slices of cheese on top and cover with the remaining zucchini mixture. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs, drizzle with oil and place on the stove. Cook, covered and on low heat, for a total of 25 minutes, taking care to turn the savory pie, as you would with an omelette, halfway through cooking.

> Once cooked, gently turn the savory courgette pie out of the pan onto a serving plate, let it settle for a few minutes and then serve.
