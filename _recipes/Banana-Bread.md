* `450 g` Ripe bananas (the pulp of about 4)
* Lemon juice to taste

> To prepare the banana bread, start by peeling the bananas and cutting them into slices. Transfer the bananas to a bowl and sprinkle them with lemon juice to prevent them from blackening, then mash them with a fork until they become a puree.

---

* `120 g` Soft butter
* `120 g` Sugar
* `2` Eggs
* `6 g` Baking powder
* `1 pinch` Fine salt
  
> In another bowl, place the butter in pieces, soft but still plastic, together with the sugar. Work with the electric whisk until you obtain a smooth mixture, then pour in one egg at a time, so as to incorporate them better. Add the baking powder and a pinch of salt, always keeping the whisks on.

---

* `200 g` Flour

> At this point add the banana puree and mix with a spatula to combine it with the mixture. Sift the flour directly into the bowl.

---

* `3 g` Bicarbonate
* `½ teaspoon` Cinnamon powder

> Also add the bicarbonate and flavour with the cinnamon, then incorporate the powders mixing with the marisa.

---

* Butter
* Flour

> Pour the resulting mixture into a 22.5x8.5 cm cake mould, previously buttered and floured. Level the surface and make a lengthwise incision with the blade of a knife dipped in melted butter .

---

> Cook in an oven preheated to 180°C for approximately 60 minutes. After this time, check the cooking with a toothpick, then remove from the oven and leave the banana bread to cool in the mold before removing it from the mold and cutting it into slices!
