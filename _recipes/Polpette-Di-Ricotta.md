* `400 g` ricotta
* grated parmesan cheese to taste
* sale
* pepe qb
* `10` fresh basil leaves
* `2` medium eggs
* `140 g` stale bread

> Prepare all the ingredients for the meatballs on the work surface. We recommend buying the ricotta at least a day in advance so that it loses the excess whey. In a bowl, mix the eggs with the ricotta, then add the parmesan, fresh basil, soaked but squeezed bread and finally salt and pepper.
